# MAINXP — Finance System (Phase 3)

Optional globally; serious when enabled. Nothing here is implemented in Phase 0/1 —
this is the binding plan.

## Scope

Accounts, balances, income, expenses, budgets, debt, savings, subscriptions, business
finances, cash flow, upcoming bills. Currency-aware (CHF default).

## Banking architecture (Part 38) — hard rule

1. **Manual balances FIRST.** 2. CSV/statement import. 3. Open-banking provider later.
`BankingProvider` abstraction with a `manual` adapter; **never fake direct bank
connectivity**. The system must be fully useful with manual data.

## Receipt camera (Part 37)

Photo → AIProvider.vision extracts merchant, date, amount, currency, VAT, category,
personal/business, payment method + confidence. Uncertain → ask user. Duplicate
detection: (merchant, date, amount) fingerprint + image hash. Original image stored
in private (non-public) storage — NOT `public/uploads` (that path is for the
real-estate site's public photos).

## Safe to Spend (Part 39)

cash available − upcoming bills − minimum debt payments − savings commitments −
emergency buffer = **SAFE TO SPEND**, with the calculation always shown transparently.

## Can I afford this? (Part 40) & Money coach (Part 41)

Practical recommendation from balance, bills, budget, debt, savings target, income
timing. Numbers, never shame: "CHF 300 restaurant budget, CHF 438 spent → CHF 138 over."

## XP

WEALTH XP from: staying inside budget for a period, debt reduction events, savings
contributions, income growth — via ledger with idempotent source events. Never from
merely entering data.
